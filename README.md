# PS5-FO4-New-Wasteland
A definitive mod guide for Fallout 4 on next-gen / )PlayStation 5. 
As of now this is a cold hard list, will update when I find time. 
Mods are grouped by category in the Creation Club

## Creation ClubC Content

### Creation Club / Bethesda 
Some creations go on sale at a cost of 0 and they rotate! It's worth checking out.
These are the Bethesda / Creation Club category creations I went for at that time.
I am not sure if all (for example X-02 Power Armor or Enclave Remnants) are free all the time, so I grouped them here as well.
